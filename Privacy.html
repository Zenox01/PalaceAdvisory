               <h4> IP addresses and use of “cookies”</h4>
                <p>We collect information about your computer, including 
                where available your internet protocol (“IP”) address, operating system and browser type, 
                for system administration. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your 
                computer when you use the internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, 
                administer our site, analyse trends, track users’ activity within the application, and gather broad 
                demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve our site.
                
                We do use cookies that are vital for the basic functionality of the website. A cookie is a small data file that our server sends to your browser when you visit the site. Cookies will only be stored to improve the performance of the site in order to retrieve data in the most effective way and notify the user of previous activities. You can delete cookies at any time or you can set your browser to reject or disable cookies. If you are unsure how to do this, follow this link where you will find instructions for many of the most popular web browsers: http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/stop-cookies-installed.html.
            
                </p>
                
              <h4>  Where we store your Personal Data</h4>
               <p> The Personal Data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside Switzerland and the European Economic Area (“EEA”). Such destination countries may have different levels of privacy protection than in your country of residence.
                
                Your Personal Data are processed by staff operating outside Switzerland and the EEA who work for us or for one of our group companies, affiliates or suppliers. These staff are engaged in the provision of support services. By submitting your Personal Data via our site, you agree to any such transfers, storage or other processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your Personal Data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
                
                These steps include imposing contractual obligations on the recipients of your Personal Data to protect that Personal Data, using standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission. We may alternatively require approved codes of conduct or certification mechanisms to be in place.
                
                Please contact our data protection team at the address in the Contact section to obtain more information about our contractual clauses imposed on third party recipients of your Data.
                
                We store your Personal Data carefully. We have implemented, and follow, industry standard 
                measures to protect against unauthorized access to, and unlawful interception or processing of,
                 Personal Data. Once we have received your Personal Information, we will use strict procedures and 
                 
                 security features to prevent unauthorized access.
            </p>
                <h4>Disclosure of Personal Data</h4>
               <p>We may disclose your Personal Data to any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding parent company and its subsidiaries and/or affiliates. Furthermore, we disclose your Personal Data to our business partners (DocuSign and Certisign for electronic signature, Plivo for SMS communication, Microsoft for hosting, Google for web analytics) insofar and for as long as it is necessary to perform our services. We oblige our business partners to assume and apply the same rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
                
                Other than previously specified in this Privacy Policy, we may also disclose your Personal Data to third parties in the following circumstances:
                
                If we become part of another organization, such organization will possess the Personal Data collected by us, and it will apply and assume the same rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.
                If we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personal Data, or part of it, in order to 
                comply with any applicable legal or regulatory obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our Terms of
                 Use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers, or others.</p>
               <h4> Retention of Personal Data</h4>
             <p>   The time period for which we shall retain and keep Personal Data varies according to 
                 
                
                various statutes and what the information is used for. In some cases, there are legal 
                requirements to keep data for a minimum period of time. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for
                 us to retain and keep the information, we will retain and keep it only insofar and as long as it is
                  necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.</p>
                
               <h4> Non-personal information</h4>
              <p> Non-personal information is information that does not identify you individually. We collect non-personal
                 information from your computer, such as your Web browser, the date and time of your Web site visit,
                  the Web address from which you accessed our site, the number of visitors to the site, the pages viewed,
                   and the length of time on the Web site.
                </p>
               <h4> Marketing</h4>
               <p> We collect data to analyse the website in general, to gain insights into how to improve our services
                   
                
                and to target our marketing measures to your identifiable needs. You have the right to ask us not to
                 process your Personal Data for our marketing purposes. We will inform you (before collecting your data) 
                 if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third 
                 party for our own marketing purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking
                 certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your Personal Data. You can also exercise the right at any 
                 time by contacting us at the address in the Contact section. If you consent to the use of your Personal 
                 Data for marketing purposes, you can change your mind and opt-out of this at any time. You can do this by
                  selecting ‘unsubscribe’ at the bottom of any marketing email you receive from us, or at any time by 
                  contacting us at the address in the Contact section.</p>

                      provided consent for us to use, where we used the information to perform a contract with you or 
                      where the processing of your Personal Data is carried out by automated means.
                </p>
                <h5>Right to Object</h5>
            <p>  You have the right to object to your Personal Data being processed for a particular purpose or 
                to request that we stop using your Personal Data.
                </p>
                
                <h5> Right to Withdraw Consent</h5>
             <p>   Where our processing of your Personal Data is based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw
                 
                your consent at any time. If you do so we will stop processing your Personal Data unless there is 
                another lawful basis we can rely on, if which case we will inform you of this.
                </p>
                
                <h5> Right to Reject Automated Individual Decision-Making</h5>
             <p>   You can request not to be subject to a decision based on 
                 automated processing and to have safeguards put in place if you are being profiled based on your personal
                  data;</p>
                
                <h5>Rights regarding Marketing Communications</h5>
              <p>  The right to ask us to stop or to start sending marking messages at any time.
                
                If you want to exercise these rights, you should contact us at the address in the Contact section.
                </p>
                
               <h4> Modifications to this Privacy Policy</h4>
               <p> We reserve the right to change, alter or otherwise modify this Privacy Policy at any time by
